AExplanation
HTML Structure: The HTML contains a header and a div with the ID product-list, which will hold the product information.

Fetch API: The fetchProducts function uses the Fetch API to make a GET request to your DRF endpoint. Make sure to replace the URL with the correct one for your setup. If your API is hosted somewhere, use that URL.

Error Handling: If the fetch operation fails, an error message will be logged to the console.

Display Products: The displayProducts function takes the fetched product data and creates HTML elements to display each product's name, photo, price, and description.

Load Products on Page Load: The fetchProducts function is called when the window loads, ensuring that products are fetched and displayed as soon as the page is ready.

3. Run Your HTML File
Open your HTML file in a web browser. If your DRF API is running and accessible, you should see the list of active products displayed on the page.

Additional Considerations
CORS: If your API and HTML are served from different origins, you may need to enable CORS in your Django settings using django-cors-headers.

Copy
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'corsheaders',
    ...
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
    ...
]

CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True  # For development only; restrict in production!
Styling: You can customize the CSS to improve the visual presentation of the product list.

Deployment: When deploying, ensure your API URL is updated to the production endpoint.

This setup will allow you to fetch and display active product data dynamically using JavaScript and HTML. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask!
